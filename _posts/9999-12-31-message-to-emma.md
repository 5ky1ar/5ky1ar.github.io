title: A Message To Emma Luke
---

Well Emma, we meet again after god knows how long, a year at least? I don't know. I know I have some explaining to do here, since you are probably wondering why I decided to hack your account and how can I get it back, so just bear with me, okay?
# Why I Hacked Your Account
This all started in a discord call back in like May or June of last year when Andrei was saying that you were _"supposedly"_ in a lesbian relationship with some girl named Teagan. At the time I knew exactly who he was talking about and I honestly thought you and Teagan were just really good friends and nothing else. Now fast forward to June 8, which was National best friends day. Teagan posted pics of you saying you were her "wife" and I sarcastically corrected her by posting her IG story on my snapchat story saying that you were _my_ "wife". Now heres where things get interesting: 24 hours later, Teagan adds me on SC and goes on a rant saying how fucked up I am for making fun of you, So in a nutshell what I took away from that was that Teagan is very protective of you and is very rude to anyone that tries to make fun of either you or her. Now fast forward to your birthday, I post a screenshot on my story that I ordered pizza to your house for the second time, because I wanted you to feel special. Now Teagan goes absolutely insane here, I believe she said something like "what the fuck is wrong with you, you are so fucked up for doing that" in all caps so she was very pissed off. Now keep in mind that I paid for the pizza with my own money and whatnot so I politely responded to her that there wasn't really anything wrong that that and then I asked her what did she get you for your birthday and then she just blocked me, so there's that. Now ever since we broke up back in 2017 I've been always hoping that maybe someday we might get back together again, now the thing is, if I tried to even talk to you you would just block me, but the thing is was that we ere following each other on IG at one point. (I know the pic is old but it's the only one I got)

Now because of this I had a slight feeling that you might still hate me to the point that I was or arch-nemesis or something (or maybe not I don't know), and unfortunately I was right when you blocked me on March 20, which completely threw any hope I had left out the window. From this point on, my life started to get worse and worse with no end in sight. I started to consider ending my life if you were always going to hate me no matter what. I started to distance myself from pretty much everyone I knew so that when I eventually deicide to end it all, I would be forgotten quickly and everyone would just move on, and since I was considering to end my life, I started to do worse in school since I thought it wouldn't matter anyway, and so my parents would constantly yell at me for not doing well as they don't want me to fail but they don't know that I am considering ending my life as I don't want them to raise suspicions so it would be easier to end my life if they simply just didn't know. The only reason why I am still here is because of _you_ Emma, you have given me the hope that I just need to keep going.

Now I realized that I can't just do nothing and expect things to change, because life doesn't work like that, but I needed to get your attention seriously and in a way where you wouldn't just be able to walk away from this and move on like nothing happened. Now my parents do know about you and I accidentally admitted once that the reason why I am on the verge of ending my life (I didn't say I wanted to end my life just very depressed or whatever I came up with at the time) was because of you and how I missed you and all that, so they suggest that I send a letter to you letting you know I miss you and was thinking about you, yes you heard me, a fucking letter, like we live in the days before the internet, fucking boomers am I right? Their idea was that we could at least be friends again and I would work my way back up with you and eventually we would be dating again. Now even if I did listen to them and send you a letter, you would probably just ignore it and then they would suggest me to send another one and you would just ignore it and eventually you get fed up and probably get a restraining order against me, and plus it has been over 3 years since we dated and I am **VERY** impatient, so obviously I didn't listen to their advice.

Now one of my hobbies was to be a hacker since I've always liked computers as a kid and since technology is basically taking our lives over, it would actually be beneficial to be someone like a hacker. Anyway, I came up with the idea of hacking your IG account, as it's something of value to you and there would be no easy way to get out of this and move on. I don't want to explain how I exactly did it as this is already long enough and you would probably not understand a thing anyway but if you are curious I am happy to tell you exactly how I did it.
# What Do I Want From This
I am going to give you 2 options, they both determine the fate of me (and possible you, but mostly me), so I would recommend to read both options very carefully and choose wisely.
# Option A
If you choose this option, you can keep your relationship you have with Teagan and as I mentioned before, I will end my own life using [Sodium Nitrate](https://www.pastebin.com/fJSQVtrf), since that will probably make you happier anyway. I won't end my life immediately since I haven't really planned my suicide too much, just the method I am going to use. I would have to get the [Sodium Nitrate](https://www.pastebin.com/fJSQVtrf), write a suicide note so my family knows why I did it, and plan when I have enough time to carry it out and not get interrupted and fail my probably only attempt.

Now in my suicide note I am going to explain that it was my decision to end my life and that you have no part in my suicide, but since my family is going to be very devistated about the loss of me and since they know about you and how I am obsessed with you, they may think that you were the one responsible for my death, there is a possibility that my family would take you to court and try to get you charged for [assisting suicide](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Assisted_death), which basically is being charged with [manslaughter](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Manslaughter) and you or your parents could serve jail time. Now I'm not saying that is going to happen, but I can't control what happens to you after I die and really anything could happen, my family could get you in prison to serve justice against the loss of me, or you could walk free and nothing happens to you.

Now you may be asking yourself, isn't that basically a suicide threat and I guess that you are half right on that but the thing is that I have been having suicidal thoughts for a long time and as I mentioned before the only reason why I am even still alive at this point is because of you. Now one last thing, If you do decide this option and you change your mind at any point after since I mentioned that I won't end my life immediately, then please tell me as soon as you can. When I get around to doing it, I will text you (you probably blocked my number so I will text you using a different number) that I am going to end my life and probably say my last words to you, whatever that will be. When I text you that I am ending my life, you do not have much time before I go unconscious and eventually die, so if you still decide to change your mind about me, then you would have to call or text the numbers listed [here](https://xmg-redux.github.io/about/) since I would probably be barely conscious to really do anything.
## What Happens If I Report This To The Authorities
I strongly advice you not to, you are just making the situation worse than it has to be, if the police do show up to arrest me for making threats or whatever, then I will end my life with the gun that I have in my room and that will be the end of it.
# Option B
Now if you choose this option, unfortunately you are going to have to give up whatever relationship you have with Teagan and just be friends and **ONLY** friends. I am not saying you can't ever see Teagan again, you two can be friends still if you want, we can all co-exist, you know. If Teagan starts complaining or doesn't want to just be friends then you are going to have to explain to her that nothing lasts forever and she is going to have to learn to get go like what I did with you until recently (I've let go for over 3 years at this point, I think that's long enough)

Listen Emma, I know it has been a really long time since we last even spoke to each other and I have a theory of why you became a lesbian in the first place, and it's because you wanted someone to love, but no boys really liked you, but I guess you met Teagan whenever and whatever happened, you two fell in love eventually, I might be completely off but that's what I think at least. ow, I know I done some horrible things to you in the past, And I would like to apoligze to everything I had done to you, okay, I'm sorry. The thing is that I **DO NOT** hate you at all, and I did all those things because I am jealous of you and was being dumb and I don't want to you feel the same about me.

Emma, I just want to say that I became so attached to you that I just cant stop thinking about you, you are honestly one of the most beautiful girls I have ever met in my life and I am very happy that I have managed to come across you, I feel that we have a lot in common about each other and I feel that we could have a long lasting relationship with each other for years on end. I am always willing to come to love and support you everyday because I truly care about you very much and I want you to be happiest person you can possibly be, I just want you to remember that even through your darkest times I will always love you very much and never leave you for anyone else.

Lets just start over, and be the couple we have _should've_ been, What do you say?

And one last thing,
I love you Emma, no matter what. ♥️♥️♥️

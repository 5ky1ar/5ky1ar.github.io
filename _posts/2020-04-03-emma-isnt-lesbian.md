# Theory

My theory on Emma becoming a "lesbian" was that she was unable to find a boyfriend who truly cared for her (because she excluded me out of her life, unfortunately), and since being gay is trendy these days, she decided at some point last year to "come out" as "lesbian". At first, this made me VERY, VERY, angry, almost to the point where I thought of using my dad's M4 carbine to gun down the fuckers that convinced her to become a lesbian, now obviously I wouldn't do that if Emma herself decided to "come out" as "lesbian".

I also suspect that Emma is pretending to be a "lesbian" so I would not try to go after her anymore and move on from her and date someone else, which is something that I will never do under any circumstances. I swore to god that the only person I will ever date and marry is Emma Luke. #EmmaLuke4Life

# Evidence & Analysis

## Her TikTok Video

In [this TikTok video Emma posted](https://www.tiktok.com/@m___luke/video/6811651573912030470), it starts out... ah fuck it the video explains for itself, just go watch it.

Anyways, based from the video along and from her other TikTok videos, the only thing is considered "gay" was her being kissed

![Emma being kissed be her "girlfriend"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5ky1ar/5ky1ar.github.io/master/assets/img/vlcsnap-2020-04-11-20-32-01-082.png "Emma being kissed be her 'girlfriend'")

And even looking at it more closely, it looks like her "girlfriend" is pretending to kiss her, like her lip is just barely above her cheek or some shit.

## Mr. Obvious's YouTube Video
One of my favorite YouTubers [Mr. Obvious](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyznn3etx_6fSK7576JSrKg) made a video: [The COVID-19 Quarantine is Turning Lesbian Women Straight](https://invidio.us/watch?v=RmwC2id5zdY)

In a nutshell, the video is about a girl who was lesbian freaked about the cornavirus forcing her to quarantine herself along with her roommates. This was because she had a history with asthma and grew more insecure about the lack of support she was getting. In order to calm herself down a bit, she texted one of her roommates (male) and asked him to have a few drinks to which he agreed to. As her feed was filled with news about restraunts closing and the high death count in Italy, which made her unable to locate herself in the midst of chaos & fear. While she was drinking with him, unloading each of their anxieties about the pandemic, they ended up flirting and hooking up with each other. This made her question her sexuality on whether she was bisexual or lesbian. They ended up hooking up the next day too, which made her question whether she becoming attracted to men was to calm herself down during quarantine.

This video of his made two great points:
* from [3:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=RmwC2id5zdY?t=204) - [3:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=RmwC2id5zdY?t=212) he goes on to explain that in this day & age, homosexuality is now trendy and your sexuality has completely to do with your identity and Mr. Obvious disagrees with that saying that its unhealthy, which I personally agree with. This probably explains why Emma became a lesbian after not being able to find a boyfriend, she wanted to find love and go with the new trend so she can attempt to get TikTok famous or some bullshit, I don't fucking know.

* from [5:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=RmwC2id5zdY?t=358) to [7:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=RmwC2id5zdY?t=438) he makes a great point saying how the left and progressivism pushed their agenda on gay is the new normal and being straight is not okay, and that most girls who claim to be lesbian, have anxiety and feel like they don't fit in with society for being straight and just pretend to be lesbian so they can fit in. This is probably the case with Emma as she clearly said she has an anxiety disorder

# Conclusion

Knowing Emma since 2015, she publicly stated in an Instagram post a long time ago that she had anxiety disorder, along with a bunch of other things. Since Emma wanted somebody to love and that being gay is a trend now, she decided to "come out" as a "lesbian", which I showed above is fucking bullshit and the truth is she is pretending to be one so I will think that she is taken and I move on from her and date someone else. Emma, I know you think are smart but I obviously can see the bullshit you are trying to pull on me and its not funny anymore. You need to come clean and faking being gay for clout and attention and to date me again like the good old days because I did nothing wrong to you. #Skylar&Emma2020
